# SIFA-pytorch
This is a pytorch version of SIFA for "Unsupervised Bidirectional Cross-Modality Adaptation via Deeply Synergistic Image and Feature Alignment for Medical Image Segmentation"

If you think the code is useful, do not forget to cite my excellent UDA work, [*FPL-UDA:FILTERED PSEUDO LABEL-BASED UNSUPERVISED CROSS-MODALITY ADAPTATION FOR VESTIBULAR SCHWANNOMA SEGMENTATION*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9761706), and the code is also available in [here](https://github.com/JianghaoWu/FPL-UDA)
